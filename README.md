## Introduction

Chemical industrial plant, even with its highly developed safety related technology and regulations, is still a dangerous working environment to the workers. This project aims to reduce the number of human working on site a chemical plant by creating a ROS based remote controlled robot prototype that will allow an operator to monitor and operate the plant from a safe environment. The topics involved in this project are mainly robotics and SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping). As the software development for the robot has been completed, extensive field test is still required before this project can be concluded.
